			<p>Hi John,</p>
			<p>We can't wait to see you on our wedding day! <a id"gcal" href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&text=Eileen%20%26%20Lisa's%20Wedding&dates=20140803T190000Z/20140804T010000Z&details=&location=Revolution%20Brewery%20(2323%20N.%20Milwaukee%20Ave.%3B%20Chicago%2C%20IL)&trp=true&sprop=&sprop=name:" target="_blank" alt="Add To Google Cal">Sunday, August 3rd, 2014</a> will prove to be a big day for us all. Ceremony and reception will take place upstairs in the Brewer's Lounge at Revolution Brewing.</p>

			<p>
				Revolution Brewing is located at 2323 N. Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, Illinois. It's right off the California Blue Line stop or can be accessed off the 90/94 Fullerton exit. Happily, street parking is not metered on Sundays in the area.

				FAQs:
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: Will I get to see where they actually brew beer?<br/>
					A: Yes! Brewery tours will be plentiful.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: What should I wear?<br/>
					A: Attire should be semi-formal with respect to Sunday afternoons, in August, in a brewery. Distill that as you will. Distill... see what we did there?!
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: Why does extremely hoppy beer make Eileen's face itch?<br/>
					A: We are unsure but anticipate it has something to do with her intolerably cute red hair and freckles.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: How many times will 'Come on Eileen' be played?<br/>
					A: That remains to be seen.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: Should we let Lisa have any Jack Daniels on her wedding day?<br/>
					A: Absolutely not.
				</p>
				<p style="padding-left:15px;">
					Q: Are you crazy kids registered anywhere?<br/>
					A: Nope. Getting married 'later in life', as Lisa would put it, we already have everything we need.
				</p>

			<p>Once again, thank you for RSVPing. We can't wait to take this huge step in our lives and for you to be a part of it!</p>
			<p>Cheers,</p>
			<p>-- Eileen & Lisa</p>
