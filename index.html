									<h3>Love at First Sight: 3 Years in the Making</h3>
									<p>I met lisa on a cold, rainy day in April, 2009 at the softball fields off Lakeshore Drive. I was late, of course, and people were already practicing. Lisa was standing in the outfield. From a distance I saw she was wearing a pair of white shorts and I thought to myself, that girl must be crazy. As I got closer, I saw she had long brown hair and when I introduced myself I realized she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. As I stood there in the cold rain for those few seconds I knew something. Looking at her, I knew there was something about her. Something big and wonderful. Something more.</p>
									<p>Life had other plans for Lisa and I at that moment but we became friends and, eventually, running partners. We trained together almost every Saturday for a year and in August, 2012 we made the trip to Colorado for the Transrockies Run 3. It was an average of 20 miles a day for three days and one of the most difficult things we’d ever done. On the second day, after climbing 3,500 feet over four miles we took in breathtaking views.  after a brief rest, we began the nine mile descent. In her minimalist shoes, it may be safe to say Lisa did more sliding down the mountain than running. Then, after putting a foot in the creek all it took was one last trip for her to lose it. There we were, on the trail in the middle of nowhere and she yelled.</p>

									<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
									<p>She bent over, clenched her fists and yelled "F@#K!!!"" at the top of her lungs. She looked like popeye after having a can of spinach. I swear, her muscles even got bigger.  after a second I took a step closer and asked her if she wanted to be comforted or left alone. Without looking at me she waved me off. For the remainder of the day I ran a bit ahead of her and when she crossed the finish line she wouldn't even look at me. I thought for sure I had lost a friend on the mountain. As it turns out, all she needed was some mediocre Italian food from a restaurant in Leadville. Phew! It was a life-altering experience on many levels. It’s incredible to discover all that you are capable of achieving, even when you can’t see the finish line.</p>
									<p>Later that year, Lisa asked me out on a date. In that moment I remembered those white shorts and I knew. I knew we were finally where we were supposed to be. Together.<p>
									<p>
									Please join Lisa and I on August 3rd for a great celebration. A celebration of love and equality. A celebration of our future.</p>
									<h5 class="aside">Lisa would like to add here that we were running ~20 miles/day on less then 1,000 calories/day. The grumpiness wasn't her fault. But the minimal shoes. Those were definitely her fault.</h5>
